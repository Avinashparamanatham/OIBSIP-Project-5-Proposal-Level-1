# Autocomplete and Autocorrect Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project analyzes and optimizes autocomplete and autocorrect algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) applications, with a focus on promotional content. Using machine learning and data analytics techniques, we aim to improve text prediction accuracy and enhance user experience in content creation workflows.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze patterns in promotional text data to improve prediction accuracy
- Implement and optimize autocomplete algorithms for context-aware suggestions
- Develop efficient autocorrect mechanisms for domain-specific content
- Evaluate and compare different NLP models for text prediction
- Create meaningful visualizations of algorithm performance

## 📊 Dataset
The project utilizes a promotional dataset containing:
- Text advertisements
- Content of interest
- Fan point-of-view content
- PR materials
- Resume content
- URL data
